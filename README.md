The task involves analyzing coffee shop sales data stored in a MySQL database.
A table named sales contains details such as date, time, payment type, card number, amount, and coffee name.
SQL queries are written to filter, sort, and group sales records for deeper insightsAggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT are applied to measure sales performance.
 Subqueries are used to compare transactions against overall averages and highlight key patterns.
 A second table, coffee_prices, was created to categorize coffee types into broader groups.
 Different JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) connect sales with categories for combined reporting.
 Views are created to summarize data for quick analysis and reuse.
 Indexes are added on frequently searched columns (e.g., coffee_name, date) to optimize performance.
 Overall, the task demonstrates core SQL skills in data retrieval, manipulation, and optimization for business analysis.
